Problem Understanding

Goal: Group customers into meaningful clusters for targeted marketing, retention, or personalized strategies.

Inputs: Transactional or demographic data (e.g., age, gender, income, purchase history, frequency, recency, monetary value).

Output: Customer clusters with actionable insights.

2. Data Collection

Use datasets from Kaggle, company ERP/CRM, or retail databases.

Typical columns: CustomerID, InvoiceNo, InvoiceDate, Quantity, UnitPrice, Country.

3. Data Cleaning

Remove duplicates.

Handle missing values (dropna, fillna, SimpleImputer).

Filter invalid entries (negative prices, zero quantities).

Convert dates into useful features (e.g., Recency = days since last purchase).

4. Feature Engineering

RFM Features:

Recency: Days since last purchase.

Frequency: Number of purchases.

Monetary: Total spend.

Normalize or scale features (e.g., StandardScaler or MinMaxScaler).

Optionally include demographics (age, gender, location).

5. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Distribution plots for R, F, M.

Correlations between variables.

Boxplots to detect outliers.

Heatmaps to visualize feature relations.

6. Dimensionality Reduction (optional but useful for visualization)

PCA or t-SNE to reduce feature space.

Helps visualize customer clusters in 2D/3D.

7. Clustering

Apply clustering algorithms:

KMeans (most common).

Agglomerative Clustering (hierarchical).

DBSCAN (density-based).

KMedoids (robust to outliers).

Use the Elbow Method or Silhouette Score to decide number of clusters.

8. Cluster Analysis

Label clusters with business meaning. Example:

Cluster 1: High-value, loyal customers.

Cluster 2: Price-sensitive, infrequent buyers.

Cluster 3: New customers.

Compare RFM averages across clusters.

9. Visualization

Scatter plots (2D PCA, t-SNE).

Bar plots of RFM values per cluster.

Pie charts showing customer distribution across segments.

10. Insights & Business Strategy

High-value customers → Reward with loyalty programs.

At-risk customers → Target with discounts.

New customers → Encourage repeat purchases.

Low-value customers → Cross-sell/upsell campaigns.

11. Model Validation

Re-run clustering with different algorithms and compare stability.

Check silhouette scores.

Cross-check with domain expert feedback.

12. Deployment (optional)

Export results to dashboards (Power BI, Tableau).

Build automated pipelines with Python (scheduled clustering runs).

✅ Action plan:

Load dataset → Clean → Engineer RFM.

Scale features → Perform EDA.

Run clustering (KMeans + alternatives).

Evaluate clusters → Visualize → Derive insights.

Present results in dashboards or reports.
